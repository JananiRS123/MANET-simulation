- Cluster Neighbour Table generation 													[Done]

- Assistant Cluster Neighbour Table generation 											[Done]

- Selection of nextHop_ node 															[Done; May require modifications]

- How/when to add destination address in a packet 										[Done]

- Set BS as next hop for nodes one hop away from the BS 								[Done]

- Relaxation packet mechanism 															[Done]
	> The relaxation packet is a high priority packet and so it must be successfully received by
	  all the neighbours.
	> Be in sleep mode. [Use a new thread to wait for the specified duration and then rebroadcast
						 an ACTIVATION packet and exit]
	> After a certain time period wake up and rebroadcast an 'activation' packet.

- Recursive routing function 															[Done]

- Running simulation with multiple threads for a single event						[Done; With unidentified bugs]
	> The program goes abnormal for more than 100 threads.
	
- Keeping track of simulation time														[Done]

- Energy consumption mechanism															[Partially Done]
	> Energy spent per bit = Joules per bit	[Done]
	
	> Distance is also a factor for energy consumption	[Immediate action required]
	
	> Invoke relaxation packet transmission on threshold energy level [!!! Unidentified thread deadlock; SOLVED]
		> Thread deadlock is occuring somewhere in the call sequence
			Energy::spend() --> notifyRelax() --> broadcast() --> send_noBwDelay()
			--> recv() --> Energy::spend()
		> Try different mutex type!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		> Deadlock was in the function Node::reachedThreshold().
		
- Energy information sharing														[IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED]

- Generating trace data																	[Done]

- Data transfer rate and energy consumption of multiple bit transmission				[Done]
	> Packet Transmission time(Latency)

- Real network like situations														[Need refinement]
	> Packet drops [Currently depends on queue size only. No other factors]
	> Energy reaching threshold levels [Done]

- Assign a node as dead																	[Done]

- Modify trace format
	> Add column for current residual energy.	[Done]
	> Add column for flow id; like ns2. 		[Maybe]
