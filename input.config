# These are the significant events that are given by the user. These events internally generates there own events to perform their tasks.
# Example: 'SENSE_EVENT' event will generate internal events like- producing sensed data, forwarding it to CH, Data-aggregation by CH,
# 			CH forward data to its next hop, so on.
